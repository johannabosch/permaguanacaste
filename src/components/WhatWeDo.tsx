            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg font-maname text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Every project begins with careful observation and analysis of your land's unique characteristics. 
              We work with natural patterns, climate, soil, water flow, and existing ecosystems to create 
              designs that are both beautiful and functional.

            <p className="text-lg font-maname text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Following Bill Mollison's core principles of <em>care for the earth</em>, <em>care for people</em>, 
              and <em>fair share</em>, we ensure that every design contributes to a more sustainable and 
              abundant future for all.

            <p className="text-lg font-maname text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              We begin with comprehensive site analysis, studying your land's topography, microclimates, 
              water patterns, and soil conditions. This foundation allows us to design systems that work 
              harmoniously with nature rather than against it.

              Through collaborative planning sessions, we integrate your vision with ecological principles, 
              creating detailed designs that maximize productivity while minimizing environmental impact. 
              Every element serves multiple functions, creating resilient and regenerative landscapes.
